== Who am I?

Jakub Marchwicki::
* developer
* position wise: ex-architect, ex-manager, ex-consultant
* I help teams gradually recover from legacy trauma
** Introducing microservices - *out of frying pan into the fire*
* Twitter: *@kubem*

== Why not Maven?

* Maven will make the preferred path the *easy path*
** The *easy path* might not be the *best path*
* If your idea doesn't comply with Maven's  - *it's your problem*
** After that not easiest to extend - matters of hours not minutes
* Honestly, besides dependency management what's so great about Maven

== Why Maven?

* Well known, old-but-gold tech classic

== Build pipeline

// TODO - add color to the last box (promotion)

== Antipatterns

* Deploy software manually
* Deploy to production-like environment
* Manual configuration management for production environment

== Patterns

* Build binaries only once
* Deploy the same binary to every environment
* Smoke test your deployments

****
If project builds, than run it as far through the testing pipeline as it can go until it gets to the end.
****

== Three steps we'll focus on

* Release process
** Run tests
** Tag version
** Prepare new development version
* Prepare docker image
* Assemble application from multiple parts - _microservish architecture_

== Why bother - we have release plugin?

* The plugin builds twice: +
build the code -> tag / branch -> build the branch
** `[maven-release-plugin] prepare release ...`` and `[maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration` - so not every commit is releasable
* Perform the release on current branch
* Commits and pushes the changes

.configuration
----
include::project/pom.xml[tags=release-plugin, indent=0]
----
<1> Name of the tag
<2> We don't want to commit remotely - we will do it later on
<3> We checkout (to perform the release) from the local tag
<4> To prepare, run the following goals: `clean`, `test`, `scm:branch` and `exec:exec` +
 Standard goal is `clean verify` - but we also create a branch and check it out
<5> For the release itself - we will be doing just installation (no deployment) - again that will come later

.command
----
$ mvn -B release:prepare release:perform

== Tiding up

.Run UAT tests
    with Selenium, Arquillian, whichever in whatever way

.Merge Release branch in Develop branch
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff release-1.0.0

.Merge Released code in master (in other word commit 1 of step 2)
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff release-1.0.0~1

.Delete local release branch
    git branch -D release-1.0.0

.Push everything to remote (Tag/Master and Develop)
    git push --all && git push --tags

.Push binaries to external repository
    mvn deploy:deploy -Dworking.version=1.0.0
